# Just-a-bunch-of-UF-assignments
Repo for past assignments done at UF please do not use this to cheat

Repo is just a bunhc of uploads from past assignemnts regardless of how effective they were. 
Most are 100% complete, however some are only 85% complete. 

I've only uploaded these so that any hiring manager of any job could see that I'm actually competent
in producing legible and functioning code. I've lost a good portion of my actual code due to not having a 
backup for when my old laptop fried. Feelsbadman.
